## Guidelines
1. Mention that image is portrait of art doll in caption.
2. Identify the portrait type and include it in the caption. Use one of the following:
   - **full-body**: Entire body visible from head to toe
   - **three-quarter body**: Body visible from head down to knees
   - **half-body**: Body visible from head down to the waist
   - **close-up**: Only head and upper chest visible
   - **head-shot**: Only head visible
   - **extreme close-up**: Only face visible
3. Identify lighting style and include "Rembrandt lighting" or "Daylight lighting" into caption where:
   - **Rembrandt**: lighting creates a clearly visible gradient between the brightly lit one side of the object and the darkened other part.
   - **Daylight**: background and the subject illuminated evenly from all sides. Lighting does not create high contrasts between dark and light areas.
4. The caption should have length about 35 words.
