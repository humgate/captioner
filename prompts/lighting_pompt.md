## Lighting style identification guide
### Use one of the following:
- **Rembrandt light**: A photograph in general in dark tones, with a dark, often almost black background and the object 
    illuminated unevenly, but mainly on one side. This type of lighting creates a clearly visible gradient between the 
    brightly lit one side of the object and the darkened other part, thereby creating the illusion of a three-dimensional 
    image for the viewer and at the same time sharply separating the object from the background. 
    This type of lighting is often called "Rembrandt light"
- **Flat light**: A photograph in general in light tones, with a light gray or white background and the subject illuminated 
    evenly from all sides. This type of lighting does not create very bright and very dark areas and high contrasts between
     them. This type of lighting creates the illusion of lighting as on a cloudy day outside. This type of lighting is often
      called "Flat light"
